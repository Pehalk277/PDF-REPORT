# 📊 Student Habits and Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This is the second task of my internship, focused on **data analysis and report generation**.  
The project reads student performance data from a CSV file, performs analysis using **Pandas**, and generates a **PDF report** using the `fpdf` library.

## 🧑‍💻 What the Project Does
- Reads student data from a CSV file (`student_habits_performance.csv`).
- Analyzes key metrics:
  - Total number of students
  - Average exam score
  - Number of students participating in extracurricular activities
  - Average study hours per day
  - Average social media usage
  - Maximum attendance percentage
- Generates a clean, formatted PDF report with the analysis.

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas fpdf
